# AND-GATE
An AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that performs logical multiplication.
It has two or more input signals and one output signal.
The output of the AND gate becomes high (1) only when all input signals are high otherwise the output remains low (0)
The AND operation is represented by a dot (·) or multiplication symbol.
